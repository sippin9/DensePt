# DensePt
 This is a sample of implementing point cloud densification from sparse lidar scan.

 The expand_points_via_alpha_shape_and_knn() function can be simply integrated into other projects for usage.
 
 Idea from 
 Multimodal Virtual Point 3D Detection, https://tianweiy.github.io/mvp/

# To Run:
 1. Modify the KITTI dataset path in the .py file.
 
 2. Put the .py file into Hanwen's gs_obj_SLAM folder and run it.
